  <h2>Our Credo</h2>

Interacting with <abbr title="Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> should be a positive experience. Digital products should be easy to use. The needs of people — not the constraints of internal systems — should drive our decisions.</p>

<p><strong>We are responsible to the American people</strong> — the taxpayers who make our work possible. As we build modern products and systems we must increase efficiency and decrease cost. We must make technology at <abbr title="Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr> reliable, adaptable, responsive, scalable, and sustainable.</p>
<p><strong>We are responsible to the <abbr title="Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr></strong> — the institution that we support. As we attract talent from across industry to work beside top performers within <abbr title="Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr>, we must show that better results are possible, faster. Our partnerships must strengthen and empower people and teams within the <abbr title="Department of Veterans Affairs">VA</abbr>, building internal capacity that is ready to tackle any challenge.</p>
